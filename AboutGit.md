# About Git

This is an example markdown document briefly explaing about git, how markdown documents can be created and how they can be shared among different team members.
Git is a software which is widely used by software developers for a collaborative working experience. It aims to help in co-ordinating differnet changes to the source code made by different developers during devlopment of a certain project. It keeps track of changes to different files over time, therby allowing different programmers or collaberators to work and make changes to souce code while creating different versions, without disrupting the current versions. Any new additions to a program can be easily added to its current version. Therfore, git enables different members to work remotely on the same project and also to keep track of the different versions of a project. We can create repositories which can store any information regarding a project by maintaing different files, images, spreadsheets, all the related codes and program files. 
Git is installed locally on a system, while in contrast github is a cloud service hosted on the web. It is a hosting service for git repositories.

# How I created and used my Git Account today
I first created an account on Github by signing up for it. I then installed Git on my Ubuntu system using the command 
sudo apt-get install git -y
I went ahead and created my first repository Software-Lab on Github with a read me file describing the contents of this repository.
I confired my git installed on my system with github by using the git config commands and providing my credentials. I also tried cloning the repository I created earlier on GitHUb onto my Ubuntu operating sytem. 
Later I created an example markdown document  AboutGit.md on my system using a text editor and added,committed  it onto Gitand pushed it onto my GitHub repository. I was exploring different ways to create and edit markdown documents. 
Now that my newly created markdown document was reflected on GitHub repository, I  tried editing it on Github itself writing the current document.

# How I shared my document with other classmates
I asked them their git usernames and gave them the access to my current repository by Settings->Manage Access-> and adding theeir usernames.
